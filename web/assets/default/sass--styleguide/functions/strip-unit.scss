/*
 *   This one needs some explanation:
 *
 *   It might look weird at first but it's actually pretty logical: to get a number without its unit, you need to divide
 *   it by 1 of the same unit. To get 42 from 42em, you need to divide 42em by 1em.
 *
 *   So we divide our number by the same number multiplied by 0 to which we then add 1.
 *   With our example, here is what happen: 42em / 42em * 0 + 1, so 42em / 0em + 1 so, 42em / 1em so 42.
